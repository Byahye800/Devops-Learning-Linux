DevOps Linux Learning



This repository documents my structured Linux learning as I build the technical depth required for modern DevOps roles. Every file in this repo comes from real command‑line practice, deliberate study, and consistent refinement. My aim is simple; develop strong fundamentals, document them clearly, and maintain a professional workflow from the beginning.



\- A growing command‑line skillset  

\- Practical understanding of Linux behaviour  

\- Clean documentation habits  

\- A version‑controlled workflow aligned with industry expectations  



Working through these topics has strengthened my technical confidence.

What I’ve learned so far:



\- Terminal navigation and file system control  

\- Permissions, ownership, and secure file handling  

\- Process management and system behaviour  

\- Networking essentials and diagnostic tools  

\- Text processing with grep, sed, awk, and pipelines  

\- Git fundamentals: staging, committing, pushing, and maintaining clarity in the repo

The `Linux/notes/` directory contains focused, topic‑driven documentation.

Notes Folder: 



\- : file-permissions.md - chmod, chown, rwx logic, practical permission handling  

\- : linux-basic-commands.md - navigation, file operations, search tools  

\- : networking.md -  IP basics, connectivity checks, essential networking utilities  

\- : processes-management.md - monitoring, controlling, and understanding system processes  

\- : text-processing.md -  grep, sed, awk, redirection, and pipelines for real‑world data handling  



This structure reflects a methodical approach and each file targets a core Linux competency.



Bandit Progress:

The Bandit wargame has been a key part of developing real command‑line fluency.  

For each level, I documented:



\- The commands used  

\- The reasoning behind them  

\- What the level revealed about Linux behaviour  

\- A concise summary capturing the core lesson  



This demonstrates analytical thinking, pattern recognition, and comfort navigating unfamiliar environments.



Linux Skills Gained:



\- Strong terminal confidence  

\- A clear understanding of permissions and system security  

\- The ability to read, interpret, and troubleshoot system output  

\- A disciplined documentation style  

\- A mindset focused on continuous technical improvement  



This repository demonstrates a methodical approach to technical growth, combining structured learning with disciplined documentation to build a solid, reliable foundation in core computing skills.
