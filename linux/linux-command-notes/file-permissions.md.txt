File Permissions

Linux uses a clear permission model to control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Understanding these basics gives you better control over your system and helps you use commands like chmod, chown, and 
more effectively.

1: ls -l = Shows permissions, ownership, and timestamps in long listing format.

Example Output:
$ ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 120 Feb 4 10:21 config.yaml drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Feb 4 10:22 scripts 

DevOps Usage:
Used to inspect file permissions, ownership, and directory structures before deployments, troubleshooting, or automation tasks.

2: chmod = Changes permission settings using numeric or symbolic notation.

Example Output:
$ chmod 644 config.yaml $ ls -l config.yaml -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 120 Feb 4 10:21 config.yaml 

DevOps Usage:
Used to fix permission issues on config files, scripts, SSH keys, or deployment artifacts.

3: chmod u+x = Adds execute permission for the file owner.

Example Output:
$ chmod u+x deploy.sh $ ls -l deploy.sh -rwxr--r-- 1 user user 89 Feb 4 10:25 deploy.sh 

DevOps Usage:
Used to make scripts executable before running automation tasks, CI/CD jobs, or deployment scripts.

4: chown : = Changes the user and group that own a file.

Example Output:
$ sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu app.log $ ls -l app.log -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 5321 Feb 4 10:30 app.log 

DevOps Usage:
Used when services (Nginx, Docker, Jenkins, etc.) require files to be owned by specific system users.

5: chgrp = Updates the group ownership of a file.

Example Output:
$ sudo chgrp developers script.sh $ ls -l script.sh -rwxr--r-- 1 user developers 120 Feb 4 10:32 script.sh 

DevOps Usage:
Used to give a team or service group access to shared scripts, logs, or configuration directories.

6: stat = Displays detailed file information, including permission bits.

Example Output:
$ stat config.yaml File: config.yaml Size: 120 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 regular file Device: 802h/2050d Inode: 1234567 Links: 1 Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: (1000/user) Gid: (1000/user) Access: 2025-02-04 10:21:00.000000000 Modify: 2025-02-04 10:21:00.000000000 Change: 2025-02-04 10:21:00.000000000 


DevOps Usage:
Used when diagnosing permission issues, checking inode details, or verifying timestamps during debugging.

7: chmod -R = Applies permission changes to a directory and all items inside it.

Example Output:
$ chmod -R 755 scripts/ $ ls -l scripts/ -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 120 Feb 4 10:40 build.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 98 Feb 4 10:40 deploy.sh 

DevOps Usage:
Used to apply permissions across entire directories — common when preparing web server folders, deployment directories, or shared project structures.

Permission Basics 
- r = read
- w = write
- x = execute
- u = user
- g = group
- o = others
- Numeric (Octal) permissions:
- 7 = rwx
- 6 = rw-
- 5 = r-x
- 4 = r--
