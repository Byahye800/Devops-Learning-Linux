Process Management

Linux provides simple tools to view running processes, check system activity, and manage tasks. These commands help you understand what your system is doing and give you basic control over starting, stopping, and monitoring processes.

1: ps aux = Shows all running processes with details like CPU and memory usage.

Example Output:
$ ps aux root 1 0.0 0.1 169260 1100 ? Ss 10:00 0:02 /sbin/init user 1324 1.2 3.5 812344 28900 ? Sl 10:05 0:10 python3 app.py 


DevOps Usage:
Used to inspect running processes, identify stuck applications, check resource usage, or find the PID of a service you need to stop or debug.

2: top = Displays real‑time system activity, including active processes and resource usage.

Example Output:
$ top PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND 1324 user 20 0 812344 28900 1200 S 12.3 3.5 0:10.23 python3 


DevOps Usage:
Used to monitor real time CPU, memory, and process activity — especially useful when diagnosing performance issues on servers.

3: htop = Interactive version of top with easier navigation and colour‑coded output (if installed).

Example Output:
$ htop (Interactive colourful dashboard showing CPU, memory, processes) 

DevOps Usage:
Used for easier, more visual process monitoring — helpful during troubleshooting sessions or when analysing system load.

4: kill <PID> = Sends a signal to stop a process using its process ID.

Example Output:
$ kill 1324 

DevOps Usage:
Used to gracefully stop a process, such as a stuck script, runaway job, or misbehaving application.

5: kill -9 <PID> = Force‑kills a process immediately using the SIGKILL signal.

Example Output:
$ kill -9 1324 

DevOps Usage:
Used to force terminate a process that refuses to stop — common when dealing with frozen deployments, zombie processes, or hung services.

6: pkill <name> = Stops processes by matching their name instead of using a PID.

Example Output:
$ pkill python 

DevOps Usage:
Used to stop multiple processes by name — useful when restarting apps, clearing stuck jobs, or killing all instances of a service.

7: systemctl status <service> = Shows the current status of a system service.

Example Output:
$ systemctl status nginx ● nginx.service - A high performance web server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled) Active: active (running) 

DevOps Usage:
Used to check whether a service is running, failed, or restarting — essential for debugging web servers, databases, and background services.


8: systemctl restart <service> = Restarts a system service to apply changes or recover from issues.

Example Output:
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx 

DevOps Usage:
Used to restart services after configuration changes, deployments, or when recovering from errors.
