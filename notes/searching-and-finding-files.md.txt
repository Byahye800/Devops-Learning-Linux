Searching & Finding Files

Linux provides powerful tools for locating files and searching through text. These commands help you quickly find what you’re looking for, whether it’s a file on your system or a specific line inside a document.

1: find <path> -name <file> = Searches for files by name within a directory.
2: grep <pattern> <file> = Searches for text inside a file.
3: grep -r <pattern> <directory> = Searches inside all files in a directory recursively.
4: locate <file> = Quickly finds files using a system‑wide database (if installed).
5: which <command> = Shows the full path of a command.
6: whereis <command> = Locates the binary, source, and manual pages for a command.
7: find <path> -type d = Lists directories within a given path.
8: find <path> -type f = Lists files within a given path
